DjangoViaPython

This is a repository of notable projects made while I was at Coding Dojo Seattle from May through September 2019.
These were all initially made while I was active in the Python section of the Coding Dojo cirriculum.
Some files will continue to have additional commits pushed. Please see individual commit comments for details.

All projects contained in this repository use the same Django-on-Python structure.
They also all employ basic CRUD commands (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manipulate data in a  database.
Below is a list of the projects in this repository, along with a short description beyond the above details.

    - books_authors_shell
        A console application that executes a series of commands that manipulates tables from multiple classes.
        Class models called "Book" and "Author" are used to create attribute tables for each class.
        The application establishes and updates Many-to-Many relationships between the two classes.

    - log_and_reg
        A web application that creates, records and verifies users.
        Has both internal and custom validations made through regular expressions.
        Encrypts user passwords through password hashing for security purposes.

    - semi_rest_TV
        A web application that allows users to post their favorite TV shows.
        The user creates a table of their favorite TV shows with a name, network and description.
        Shows are validated and custom validation error messages are returned for any errors found.
    
    - session_practice
        A web application that existed for the sole purpose of experimenting with sessions.
        Was not completed, but shows where the idea as understood and work on other projects resumed.

    - time_display
        A web application that tells time.
        First application used to obtain and display dynamic data in Django.

    - tv_shows
        An earlier attempt at semi_rest_TV. This was saved for comparison purposes.
        Served as a set of notes for a more functional build.
